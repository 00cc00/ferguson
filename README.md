## Countdown

You can tell Ferguson your upcoming events and ask him to count the remaining days.

## Games

Ferguson can start an interactive game which you can play with your real life friends.
It is based upon the playoff system.
You play little minigames like *"Who can drink the most shots in a minute?"* against one other person and the winner is reaching the next round.
The one who wins the final game can call oneself an *Amazing Human Slash Genius*.
